Adds "Edit Entry" and "Open Entry Location" options to the right-click menu of app icons in the app grid and dash.

- `Edit Entry` opens the .desktop file associated with the app using the system's default editor or a custom command configured in the extension's preferences.

- `Open Entry Location` opens the folder containing the .desktop file in the default file manager.
